wipwd's zwave management dashboard
----------------------------------

Note before: this project was ripped-off from ozw-thingy.git's rest-api
effort. That was the product of our initial ventures with openzwave as a
backend for a management dashboard. We have chosen to make this a standalone
project because we've fiddled with multiple backend solutions lately, and the
only thing that remained constant was the frontend.

That said, expect weird code indentation, poorly written code, code that does
not yet work as well as it should. This is still under heavy (albeit
occasional) development.

We do not aim at making this all the rage. There are other projects much
farther along than this one, and with proper communities to back them up. Note
that this project results from 1) wanting to play with the openzwave
libraries; 2) wanting a simple management dashboard, without needing
integration with home assistant and the likes; and 3) built with typescript.
